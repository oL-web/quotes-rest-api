# quotes-rest-api

A regular REST API built using Express, Mongoose, JWT and Passport. Features basic CRUD operations for quotes and users as well as integration tests using Jest. I made this to experiment with JWT and to finally implement a fully REST compliant server as the previous ones I made used sessions.
